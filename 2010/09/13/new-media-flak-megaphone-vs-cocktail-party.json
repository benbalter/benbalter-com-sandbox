In the not too distant future, TV's crime-process dramas may take on a very different feel.  Gone will be the days of [gun-toting detectives busting down doors, search warrant in hand][3]. Instead, as our lives become increasingly digital, investigations will be conducted by [keyboard-wielding lab techs submitting automated requests to service providers][4].  Don't be surprised if the next CSI spinoff is CSI: Inbox Inspectors Division.\n\nBut why does this shift matter?  Simply put, in [the cloud][5], there is no door for the police to kick in.  While the law is clear in that your physical files and those computer files stored on your computer itself enjoy the protections of the fourth amendment, those stored in the cloud do not, and the standards of proof required differ dramatically.[^6]\n\n![][7]\n\nConsider this: you are the target of a criminal investigation and the police believe that six months ago you e-mailed an accomplice to discuss the crime. Depending on your e-mail settings and which service you use (e.g., if the \"[leave downloaded messages on server][8]\" option is checked), the police may need only offer \"specific and articulable facts\" that they suspect the e-mail is related to the crime.[^9] That same e-mail stored on your computer (e.g., if the setting is not checked), would require a search warrant and showing of probable cause, and thus would be afforded significantly greater protections under the law.[^10]\n\nHowever, the typical \"*if you don't want it public, don't put it on the internet*\" argument doesn't apply here.  While that may be true for [photos and updates posted to social networking sites][11], as more and more of our lives (and [commercial dealings][12]) are pushed to the cloud, we're loosing our abilities to have a digital private sphere.[^13]\n\nThe good news is that it's in service providers' interest to instill confidence in the integrity of your data by [disclosing when information is shared with authorities][14] and by [pushing for legal reform ][15]to better safeguard personal data stored in the cloud. The bad news, beyond more [painfully tacky computer search scenes][16], is that before we know it, our perception of privacy may be forced to evolve.\n\nThunderstorms occur when divergent forces collide in clouds. It is becoming increasingly clear that cloud computing is in our extended forecast, but whether the imminent [digital due process][17] storm the cloud foreshadows will contain a silver privacy lining remains to be seen.\n\nPhoto credit: [garyhayes][18]\n\n [1]: http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4502026170_4bf31f04e6.jpg\n [2]: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/us/27wiretap.html?_r=1&ref=technology \"NYT: U.S. Tries to Make It Easier to Wiretap the Internet\"\n [3]: http://www.hulu.com/watch/53368/swat-best-of-breaches \"Hulu: Best of Swatch Breaches\"\n [4]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z70BmmSkMY&feature=related \"CSI Miami IP Address Lookup\"\n [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing \"Wikipedia: Cloud Computing\"\n [^6]: *Compare* Fed.

Social media is not a megaphone for a flaks to broadcast the press releases they would otherwise post elsewhere, but rather a cocktail party that provide organizations with the unique opportunity to loosen their tie, grab a drink, and work the room.</p><p>There is a generation of communications directors and public affairs vice presidents out there that see the liberalizing power of social media as a <em>liability</em>, rather than an <em>opportunity</em>. Personal interaction with stakeholders, be they students at a university or just those who enjoy <a href='http://twitter.com/jimmyjohns'>delicious, delicious sandwiches</a>,<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> allow organizations to connect with the people most passionate about their brand in a very real way.
