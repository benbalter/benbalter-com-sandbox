Many personal Web sites used lackluster TinyMCE formatting (bold, italic, bullets, nothing else) or simply stuffed pre-styled HTML into an existing page. I can&#8217;t even begin to fathom the workflows some people must go through every time they want to update their resume.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> A few purpose-built plugins offered a slightly more streamlined approach, but cluttered the backend with unnecessary and unfamiliar menus, and spawned legions of database tables to store the data.</p>\n\n<p><em>Enter WP Resumeâ€¦</em></p>\n\n<p>WP Resume is an out-of-the-box solution to get your resume online and keep it updated.
