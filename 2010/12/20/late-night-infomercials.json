The growing popularity of the cloud coupled with increasing power of smart phones has resulted in what not too long ago was tool for placing and receiving calls, today, in actuality, is a portal to one's entire digital life. Imagine if a routine traffic stop, say, for failing to signal properly, would place in the state's hands every e-mail you have ever sent, contact you have ever met, or financial transaction you have ever completed (not to mention your current [Angry Birds][2] score!). Regardless of how Orwellian it may sound, the California Supreme Court [ruled in favor of just such an outcome][3].\n\nIn *[People v. Diaz][4]*, the court ruled that a warrentless search of text messages on a cell phone confiscated subsequent to a lawful arrest did infact, constitute a valid search. While the dissent realized that mobile phones were increasingly becoming the hubs of our digital world, noting that the decision gave \"*carte blanche, with no showing of exigency, to rummage at leisure through the wealth of personal and business information that can be carried on a mobile phone or handheld computer merely because the device was taken from an arrestee's person,*\" I do not believe they fully grasped the gravity of the ruling. [^1]\n\n![][6][Much like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's characters in the movie Zoolander][7], the dissent's analysis is based on the assumption that information  \"can be carried on\" or \"in\" one's mobile phone, a reality which simply is not the case in today's increasingly cloud-centric world.\n\nToday, and even more so tomorrow, information will not be \"carried on\" a phone, but rather, that phone will merely be the vehicle used to access information stored elsewhere, information that would otherwise carry the highest expectation of privacy. Put another way, the device holds, both literally and metaphorically, the address, keys, and means to access one's digital home, a breach of privacy that would not be tolerated if it occurred in a more tangible sense.\n\nIn a world where in reality, nearly every e-mail I have ever sent or received can be accessed by opening a folder on my phone virtually indistinguishable [^2] from any neighboring folder that contains locally stored information, the majority's interpretation grants the state access to nearly everything  one says or does on a daily basis. Put another way, how much information do you think *won't* be accessible from your mobile phone in 5 years? 10 years? 20? Just scroll through your home screen. [^3]\n\nThe majority's decision was well argued by legal minds much wiser than my own, but even reading through the verbiage of the opinion, discussing the nature of containers and cavities as they relate to what is \"in\" the phone, it leads one to believe that their analysis is handicapped by [outdated concepts of storage and space][10]. [^4]\n\nWhile it may not be practical to install [Faraday cages][12] in every police station to ferret out what information can be gleamed from a mobile device without it querying a remote server (if there is any information at all), the majority's opinion fails to take into account the reality of how mobile phones are used today, let alone, how they will be most likely be used in the not-to-distant future. While the courts sort out [what fourth amendment protections are extended into the digital world][13], I for one, will be sure to put a password on my phone next time I cross the California state line.

[18]\n[^2]: Even for the technologically adept, today, it is hard to tell exactly what information exists \"on\" my phone, and what information exists \"in\" the cloud. The subject and sender of an incoming e-mail may be pushed to my iPhone automatically, for example, but the body or attachments may not download until I access the message itself. Today's calendar entries may be cached on the device (I wouldn't consider my calendar \"stored\" on my device — it's not the master copy), but yesterday's and tomorrow's agendas are both retrieved on demand from a distant server unrelated to any hypothetical search to which I may me subject.

[26]\n[^4]: It's worth noting that the word \"server\" is not mentioned once in the opinion, yet the phrase \"storage capacity\" is used no less than five times — a concept that [even as early as 2007 was considered a thing of the past][27].

After all, during peak hours, just 2% of Netflix users (via Level 3) account for <a href='http://www.slate.com/id/2273314/'>20% of all bandwidth used</a> in North America. In Comcast&#8217;s own words:</p><blockquote>\n<p><span>W</span>hen one provider… push<span>es</span> the burden of massive traffic growth onto the other provider and its customers, we believe this is not fair.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The problem with the &#8220;it&#8217;s the customer&#8217;s fault for using our service&#8221; argument, the <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/technology/companies/03att.html?_r=1'>same argument used by AT&amp;T</a> not too long ago, is that, if they haven&#8217;t already, service providers need to realize the Internet is here to stay. We as consumers like browsing the net. We like images. We like YouTube videos. We like interactive content. We like streaming stuff, and tomorrow we may like holograms or virtual reality or whatever the next cool, shiny thing is. Consumers simply can&#8217;t get enough rich, bandwidth-intensive content, and if you&#8217;re an internet service provider, you can&#8217;t complain when your customers use your service to do just that.</p><p>True, this may simply be <a href='http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/isp-quarrel-par/'>another petty dispute</a> between service providers as <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/ceciliakang/statuses/9730130310078464'>Comcast claims</a>, but the bigger problem with Comcast&#8217;s decision, however, is that Comcast is not simply a <em>service</em> provider (tubes), but with the <a href='http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/netflix-partner-says-comcast-toll-threatens-online-video-delivery/'>impending NBC merger</a>, also a <em>content</em> provider (the stuff in those tubes). This decision marks this first practical case where a service provider is actually taking steps to single out and discriminate against their competitor&#8217;s content. As Level 3′s Chief Legal Officer <a href='http://www.marketwatch.com/story/level-3-communications-issues-statement-concerning-comcasts-actions-2010-11-29?reflink=MW_news_stmp'>put it</a>:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Comcast is putting up a tollbooth at the borders of its broadband internet-access network, enabling it to unilaterally decide how much to charge for content which competes with its own cable TV and Xfinity-delivered content.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The Level-3/Comcast arrangement spells bleak hope for any future in which the Internet&#8217;s information democratization ethos continues – perhaps a commercialized future <a href='http://io9.com/5610328/how-the-googleverizon-proposal-could-kill-the-internet-in-5-years'>not too dissimilar from today&#8217;s tiered broadcast/cable TV system</a> — and a future unequivocally bad for consumers, regardless of what the FCC may or may not decide <a href='http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/11/lawmakers_push_fcc_to_vote_on.html'>later this month</a>.</p><p>Consider this: as Comcast&#8217;s customers increasingly <a href='http://lifehacker.com/5667680/ditching-cable-for-the-web-how-much-can-you-save-buying-renting-or-streaming-tv'>look to their computers for video content</a> rather than their cable box, Comcast can either squeeze that lost revenue out of its customers by bringing an <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/comcast-internet-access-2010-11'>end to all-you-can-eat Internet</a>, in which case we&#8217;ll see an increase in our cable bill, or they can make up that lost revenue on the other end, by charging contest providers (like Level 3) a surcharge, forcing those services to offset their increased overhead by passing along the cost in the form of monthly fees, in which case we&#8217;ll see it on our Netflix/iTunes/Facebook bill instead. Either way, the decision forecasts an inevitable flow of money from our pockets to Comcast&#8217;s.</p><p>Any time the nation&#8217;s <a href='http://www.comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=887'>largest</a> anything makes a &#8221;<a href='http://www.comcast.net/articles/finance/20101130/US.Level.3.Comcast/'>take it or leave it</a>&#8221; offer demanding a fee for an otherwise mutually beneficial relationship like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering'>peering</a>, the transaction deserves a certain degree of scrutiny, especially when it creates a catch-22 in that company&#8217;s favor. Is Comcast <em>trying</em> to kill the Internet? Probably not. <em>Will</em> they?

In its decision, the district court declared the 1986 Stored Communications Act (SCA) <a href='http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0377p-06.pdf'>2</a> unconstitutional on the grounds that it allowed what was tantamount to a traditional search, but without the required showing of probable cause.
