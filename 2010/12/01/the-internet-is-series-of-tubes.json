Warshak][2].* The court, which upheld a temporary injunction on a fraud investigation involving the all-too-familiar [late-night \"Smilin' Bob\" informercials][3], extended the fourth amendment's warrant requirements to messages stored on third-party servers. The Sixth Circuit wrote:\n\n> \"[T]he ISP is the functional equivalent of a post office or a telephone company… [T]he police may not storm the post office and intercept a letter, and they are likewise forbidden from using the phone system to make a clandestine recording of a telephone call—unless they get a warrant, that is.\" [^1]\n\nPrior to the ruling, the government could ([and regularly did][5]) obtain e-mails stored on third-party hosts like Gmail, without first needing to obtain a search warrant. In its decision, the district court declared the 1986 Stored Communications Act (SCA) [2][^2] unconstitutional on the grounds that it allowed what was tantamount to a traditional search, but without the required showing of probable cause. The court noted, \"*[g]iven the fundamental similarities between e-mail and traditional forms of communication, it would defy common sense to afford e-mails lesser Fourth Amendment protection.*\" [3][^3]\n\nThe SCA, written long before GMail's all-you-can-eat storage was ever dreamed, required a warrant for any message stored on a third-party server for fewer than 180 days, but simply required a subpoena or court order for older messages or messages that had been previously downloaded by the user, thus denying the subject of the investigation both notice and the subsequent opportunity to contest the search itself. [^1][^4]\n\nFor the most part, [the decision makes sense][9]. As e-mail moves from download-and-delete [POP-based][10] messages stored solely on a user's computer to the nearly limitless [IMAP][11], [Exchange][12], or [Web-based][13] messaging that increasingly lives in the unseen cloud, neither opportunity to download nor time spent on server are very compelling standards to determine the level of privacy that should be afforded to a message or the showing of cause that should be required to compel a host to disclose its contents.\n\nThe decision, which [tips a circuit split][14] further in favor of extending the fourth amendment, should, at least in theory, lay the groundwork to grant such protections to other forms of information stored in the cloud.  Such information may include calendars or contacts on the more obvious end of the spectrum, but may arguable be construed to cover wholesale cloud services like AWS, Salesforce, Rackspace, and Azure, a possibility not to be taken lightly following the [WikiLeaks hosting scramble][15].\n\nSurely the decision does not settle the issue outright, but it is the latest in a long march of much-needed rulings further blurring the legal distinctions between the world online and the world off, and as persuasively written as it is, is likely to prove influential as both law and technology continue to evolve side by side.\n\n\n[^1]: *United States v.

After all, during peak hours, just 2% of Netflix users (via Level 3) account for <a href='http://www.slate.com/id/2273314/'>20% of all bandwidth used</a> in North America. In Comcast&#8217;s own words:</p><blockquote>\n<p><span>W</span>hen one provider… push<span>es</span> the burden of massive traffic growth onto the other provider and its customers, we believe this is not fair.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The problem with the &#8220;it&#8217;s the customer&#8217;s fault for using our service&#8221; argument, the <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/technology/companies/03att.html?_r=1'>same argument used by AT&amp;T</a> not too long ago, is that, if they haven&#8217;t already, service providers need to realize the Internet is here to stay. We as consumers like browsing the net. We like images. We like YouTube videos. We like interactive content. We like streaming stuff, and tomorrow we may like holograms or virtual reality or whatever the next cool, shiny thing is. Consumers simply can&#8217;t get enough rich, bandwidth-intensive content, and if you&#8217;re an internet service provider, you can&#8217;t complain when your customers use your service to do just that.</p><p>True, this may simply be <a href='http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/isp-quarrel-par/'>another petty dispute</a> between service providers as <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/ceciliakang/statuses/9730130310078464'>Comcast claims</a>, but the bigger problem with Comcast&#8217;s decision, however, is that Comcast is not simply a <em>service</em> provider (tubes), but with the <a href='http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/netflix-partner-says-comcast-toll-threatens-online-video-delivery/'>impending NBC merger</a>, also a <em>content</em> provider (the stuff in those tubes). This decision marks this first practical case where a service provider is actually taking steps to single out and discriminate against their competitor&#8217;s content. As Level 3′s Chief Legal Officer <a href='http://www.marketwatch.com/story/level-3-communications-issues-statement-concerning-comcasts-actions-2010-11-29?reflink=MW_news_stmp'>put it</a>:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Comcast is putting up a tollbooth at the borders of its broadband internet-access network, enabling it to unilaterally decide how much to charge for content which competes with its own cable TV and Xfinity-delivered content.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The Level-3/Comcast arrangement spells bleak hope for any future in which the Internet&#8217;s information democratization ethos continues – perhaps a commercialized future <a href='http://io9.com/5610328/how-the-googleverizon-proposal-could-kill-the-internet-in-5-years'>not too dissimilar from today&#8217;s tiered broadcast/cable TV system</a> — and a future unequivocally bad for consumers, regardless of what the FCC may or may not decide <a href='http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/11/lawmakers_push_fcc_to_vote_on.html'>later this month</a>.</p><p>Consider this: as Comcast&#8217;s customers increasingly <a href='http://lifehacker.com/5667680/ditching-cable-for-the-web-how-much-can-you-save-buying-renting-or-streaming-tv'>look to their computers for video content</a> rather than their cable box, Comcast can either squeeze that lost revenue out of its customers by bringing an <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/comcast-internet-access-2010-11'>end to all-you-can-eat Internet</a>, in which case we&#8217;ll see an increase in our cable bill, or they can make up that lost revenue on the other end, by charging contest providers (like Level 3) a surcharge, forcing those services to offset their increased overhead by passing along the cost in the form of monthly fees, in which case we&#8217;ll see it on our Netflix/iTunes/Facebook bill instead. Either way, the decision forecasts an inevitable flow of money from our pockets to Comcast&#8217;s.</p><p>Any time the nation&#8217;s <a href='http://www.comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=887'>largest</a> anything makes a &#8221;<a href='http://www.comcast.net/articles/finance/20101130/US.Level.3.Comcast/'>take it or leave it</a>&#8221; offer demanding a fee for an otherwise mutually beneficial relationship like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering'>peering</a>, the transaction deserves a certain degree of scrutiny, especially when it creates a catch-22 in that company&#8217;s favor. Is Comcast <em>trying</em> to kill the Internet? Probably not. <em>Will</em> they?
