As the newest kid on the block, it&#8217;s one of the few government agencies to have been born in a digital era, and more importantly, without the bureaucratic baggage that all too often stymies innovation. They have a chance to &#8220;do it right&#8221; from the start… and they&#8217;re doing just that.</p><p><strong>An Agency Born of the Internet Generation</strong></p><p>Yesterday, CFPB <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/'>announced a bureau-wide preference for open source</a> in its shiny new <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/'>Source Code Policy</a>, by my <a href='http://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=source+code+policy+site%3A.gov'>crude research</a>, a first for any government agency. There are two watershed shifts here: first, that the agency not only should, but <em>must</em> evaluate open source software on equal footing to its proprietary counterparts, a comparison which I believe will <a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Wealth-Networks-Production-ebook/dp/B0015GWX0S'>increasingly fall in open source&#8217;s favor</a>, and second, that unless there&#8217;s an overriding security or similar concern <em>not to</em>, public code must be public. There&#8217;s nothing new here. All it says is that we should use the best software for the job (a no-brainier), and that that software, the public&#8217;s property, should belong to the public.</p><p>So why is this news? Plenty of government entities have <a href='http://www.fcc.gov/blog/contributing-code-back-fcc-govs-open-source-feedback-loop'>released</a> <a href='http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/02/11/whitehousegov-releases-second-set-open-source-code'>source</a> <a href='http://open.nasa.gov'>code</a>, or <a href='https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-source-procurement-toolkit'>encouraged the</a><a href='http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/infrastructure/docs/AGuidetoOpenSourceSoftware.pdf'>use of open</a>-<a href='http://www.tekno.dk/pdf/projekter/p03_opensource_paper_english.pdf'>source software</a>. But no one has come out and <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/victorzapanta/status/189390759181557760'>plainly stated that they were an &#8220;open-source agency&#8221;</a>, that open source is the new default, and that absent an affirmative step by some nay-sayer, that the public will have access to their code.That&#8217;s huge. It&#8217;s flipping the burden, and it&#8217;s the way things should be from the start.</p><p><strong>But Where&#8217;s the Beef?</strong></p><p>That said, there&#8217;s one thing the source code policy is noticeably silent on: <em>the ecosystem</em>. Posting code is great and it&#8217;s great that they&#8217;ve done the legal legwork so other agencies can follow suit, but that&#8217;s just the 1.0. The true power of open source comes not from simply publishing code, but from being a member of a broader coding community. Can a CFPB employee contribute a patch to an existing open source project on CFPB time? <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> What about contributing to a CFPB project once he or she&#8217;s left? What happens to my rights when I fork a <a href='http://github.com/cfpb'>CFPB project on GitHub</a> and send the agency a pull request? <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> Can the agency even accept my code legally? <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> There&#8217;s a lot of legal ambiguity there, and it&#8217;s just the kind of legal ambiguity a well-intentioned government attorney can seize upon to gum up the very gears that are driving this incredible move.</p><p>We&#8217;ve seen the same progression in the open data world. The 1.0 is posting 10 XML files at a gigabyte each — an arms-length relationship with developers — arguably open data simply for open data&#8217;s sake. The secret sauce lies in the relationship, in publishing APIs and web services rather than static data, to build an ecosystem around the agency&#8217;s work.</p><p><strong>An Innovation Ecosystem</strong></p><p>Imagine if government agencies served as the catalyst for a <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2012/03/05/wordpress-for-government-and-enterprise/#p[NssBlW]'>joint public-private effort to drive tomorrow&#8217;s innovation</a>. We saw this during the space race, and see it today in terms of government-funded research, but by-and-large, open-source coders have yet to be included. Sure we&#8217;ve seen the &#8220;let&#8217;s have some open-source developers build this for us for free&#8221; type challenges, but that&#8217;s about it. There&#8217;s no ecosystem, no community, no push-pull or give-and-take, and I&#8217;m worried that as CFPB&#8217;s efforts federate across government, this nuance may not federate along with it.</p><p>The agency&#8217;s already got <a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/1'>it&#8217;s first public-generated code contribution</a>, and can expect at least one more on <a href='https://gist.github.com/2343578'>their gist of the policy</a> (Ed. note: does CFPB not <em>own</em> a Blue Book?!), but the possibility of such a relationship with the citizenry doesn&#8217;t seem contemplated by the policy, let alone included as integrally as it should.</p><p>I&#8217;d love to see the next iteration of the policy have a third section, &#8220;III. Membership in the Open-Source Community&#8221; on not just publishing code they&#8217;ve developed in house — don&#8217;t get me wrong, that&#8217;s huge — but actually <em>contributing</em>meaningful code to the broader ecosystem, and working directly with the open-source community to foster an active partnership that delivers the best citizen services possible. It&#8217;s a dialog, not a code dump. There needs to be a conversation there.</p><p><strong>Procure, Publish, Participate.</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s the realization that when you use open-source software, you&#8217;re not a customer. You&#8217;re a member of a community. You&#8217;re invited to a pot-luck dinner. There&#8217;s not the same sense of entitlement you have with proprietary software. It&#8217;s not that they owe you a given feature. There&#8217;s no financial transaction there. It&#8217;s that that feature hasn&#8217;t been developed yet, but can be, the same way every other feature has evolved, through community contributions. There&#8217;s an entirely different philosophy driving the relationship.</p><p>For open source in government to work, it&#8217;s got to move beyond procuring community contributed open-source projects on the one hand, and releasing open-source code developed in house distinctly on the other. It&#8217;s about feeling a sense of belonging. It&#8217;s about the agency taking on a sense of ownership in the broader project. It&#8217;s about participation. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup></p><p>I think CFPB gets it in a big way, and the fact that this is memorialized in writing is a major step in the right direction. They&#8217;ve got the basic mechanics down — procure open–source projects, publish open-source code — but the missing secret sauce that would really drive the policy home? Participate in the open-source community as a matter of policy.</p><p>+1 CFPB, +1. <em>Welcome to the community.</em></p><div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>\n<p>In simple terms, the core of open-source projects (as distinct from community-contributed plugins or modules) are primarily fueled by &#8220;patches&#8221; (small code change sets) in response to bugs or feature requests, that get committed to the project&#8217;s codebase and released in subsequent versions. <span>24</span></p>\n<a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'>\n<p>If the project is licensed as government work, are my code contributions now government work?

These simple words, typed by an open-source developer operating under the pseudonym &#8220;iceeey,&#8221; may represent the first collaborative effort between the federal government and the broader open-source community, and surely represents a tangible win for the open-government movement as a whole.</p><p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is in a unique position. As the youngest federal agency, they have the opportunity to reimagine many day-to-day business processes for an internet era, and to share that innovation across government. One such process is the means by which federal employees apply for and receive subsidies to offset the cost of public transportation to and from work. Having created an application that alleviated the need to shuttle time-consuming, paper-based forms from building to building within their own agency, the Bureau sought to package up the solution, and publicly release the source code for other federal agencies to use and expand upon. The logic was simple: solve the problem once, solve it everywhere.</p><p>But the code was not simply made available for government employees to access. The code was placed on <a href='http://github.com/'>GitHub</a> – a popular source code sharing service – for anyone to download and explore, and within days of CFPB publishing its <a href='http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/the-cfpbs-source-code-policy-open-and-shared/'>recently announced Source Code Policy</a>, someone did just that.GitHub user &#8220;iceeey&#8221; <a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/1'>submitted a proposed change</a> – known in developer parlance as &#8220;forking the project&#8221; and submitting a &#8220;pull request&#8221; — correcting a misspelling on the form initially presented to new employees (&#8220;roundtrip&#8221; was accidentally spelled &#8220;rountrip&#8221;).</p><p>Admittedly a minor change (&#8220;one small step for grammar?&#8221;), but notable for the underlying first that it represents: the opportunity to create efficiencies across government by partnering with the broader community of civically engaged developers.</p><p>Open-source software (software for which the underlying source code is made publicly available) as a vehicle for a more open and more efficient government is nothing new. Behind the scenes, countless agencies rely on open-source software for various business functions, and many have even chosen to publicly publish the source code underlying the applications that they themselves have built in-house to tackle unique challenges. But this seemingly innocuous missing &#8220;d&#8221; and its subsequently submitted fix represents the first time a federal agency has directly collaborated with open-source developers to better its own day-to-day tools.</p><p>Iceeey has <a href='https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/2'>already submitted his second pull request</a> (&#8220;more typos&#8221; he joked with an emoticon smiley), and I hope more agencies and more open-source developers will follow suit. Such collaborations empower agencies to do more with less; put better, more robust tools in the hands of federal employees as they carry out agency mission; and undoubtedly represent a giant-leap forward for a more open and more efficient government.</p>","related_posts":[{"url":"/2011/11/29/towards-a-more-agile-government/","title":"Towards a More Agile Government"},{"url":"/2012/04/10/whats-missing-from-cfpbs-awesome-new-source-code-policy/","title":"What's Missing from CFPB's Awesome New Source Code Policy"},{"url":"/2012/03/05/wordpress-for-government-and-enterprise/","title":"WordPress for Government - A Problem of Perception"},{"url":"/2011/11/01/federal-agility-a-cultural-solution-to-a-technical-problem/","title":"Federal Agility: a Cultural Solution to a Technical Problem"},{"url":"/2011/09/01/why-wordpress/","title":"Why WordPress"},{"url":"/2010/11/15/will-federal-contracting-officers-soon-have-their-heads-in-the-clouds/","title":"Will Federal Contracting Officers Soon Have Their Heads in the Clouds?\n"},{"url":"/2012/06/02/publishing-government-data-that-developers-will-actually-use/","title":"Publishing Government Data That Developers Will Actually Use\n"},{"url":"/2012/07/26/government-release-of-source-code-public-domain-or-open-source/","title":"Government's Release of Federally Funded Source Code: Public Domain or Open Source?
