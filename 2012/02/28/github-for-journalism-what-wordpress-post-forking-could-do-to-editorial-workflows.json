In addition to publishing <a href='http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github/all/1'>their recent story featuring the popular version control site GitHub</a> on Wired.com as they would normally, they also <a href='https://github.com/WiredEnterprise/Lord-of-the-Files'>published it on GitHub itself under a creative commons license</a>, allowing readers to fork and contribute to the story as they saw fit. In <a href='http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github-revisited/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29'>reflecting after the fact</a>, the Wired team said something that stood out to me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At Wired offices, you hear the question over and over again as we work on stories like the one you&#8217;re reading now: &#8220;Are you out of the story? I want to go in.&#8221; We have a version control problem. We publish Wired.com on WordPress. It&#8217;s a decent publishing tool, but when two people change a story at the same time, one of them doesn&#8217;t get her changes onto the final story.</p>\n\n<p>We published our GitHub story on GitHub because it was meta-cool. But we also did it to see if GitHub might actually help us solve our problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Spoiler alert: it didn&#8217;t. GitHub&#8217;s great for a lot of things, source code chief among them, but it&#8217;s not for the faint of heart. There&#8217;s a great deal of command line, and general geekery involved that raise the barriers to entry just high enough to keep it out of everyday newsrooms and editorial workflows. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Pitch:</strong> <em>What if we could re-imagine WordPress&#8217;s ease-of-use and intuitively dumb-simple workflow to introduce a layer of GitHub&#8217;s collaborative fork-and-merge horsepower under the hood?</em></p>\n\n<p>Users would have the ability to &#8220;clone&#8221; an existing post, make any changes they want, and then merge those change back into the original before publishing.There are four distinct use cases where this feature may come into play:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborative editing (by resolving two users&#8217; conflicted saves – Wired&#8217;s example)</li>\n\n<li>Saving draft changes of already-published content</li>\n\n<li>Scheduling pending changes to already-published content</li>\n\n<li>Allowing users without edit or publish capabilities to edit and submit changes to content (similar to GitHub&#8217;s pull request system)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#8217;d imagine the workflow would go something like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>User without the ability to edit an existing post has changes to make</li>\n\n<li>User &#8220;forks&#8221; the post, making any change they deem necessary</li>\n\n<li>When done, user attempts to merge changes back into the original</li>\n\n<li>Post goes into standard WordPress &#8220;pending review&#8221; workflow</li>\n\n<li>Editor is presented with diff (using the built-in diff engine), and can automatically accept changes (if there are no conflicts), or manually merge the two if necessary</li>\n\n<li>Post is re-published with updated content, revision logs merged to reflect history</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In a nutshell:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Extends WordPress&#8217;s existing revision system</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Clone existing posts, edit, and &#8220;republish&#8221;</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Schedule changes to posts, including taxonomies and metadata</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Pending changes diff view, front-end preview of changes</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Using WordPress&#8217;s pending-review system, integrates with existing plugins for notifications, management, etc.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Ability to store &#8220;commit messages&#8221; with each post revision to explain to others what changes were made and why</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Automatically merges (non-conflicted) changes (based on existing diff engine)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>One sided changes – one overwrites the other</li>\n\n<li>Two sided non-conflict changes – automatically merge</li>\n\n<li>Conflicted changes – note conflicts in fork and prepare for re-merge</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Post forking may make for a killer plugin <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> or piece of core functionality… and imagine if it could integrate with other collaboration tools like <a href='http://editflow.org/'>Edit Flow</a>, or <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/wp-document-revisions-document-management-version-control-wordpress/'>WP Document Revisions</a>? As in Wired&#8217;s example, it has the potential to fundamentally change newsrooms and other editorial workflows. All of a sudden, any content becomes either publicly or privately collaborative. Pretty cool, huh? While it may be a bit ahead of it&#8217;s time from a human standpoint, from a technical standpoint, the technology&#8217;s there — it&#8217;s nothing new — just a matter of building it, and hopefully solving the dreaded &#8220;are you out yet?&#8221; problem.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts? Would you use this? What else would you like to see it do? <a href='http://ben.balter.com/contact/'>Drop me a line</a>, or let me know in the <a href='#comments'>comments below</a>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update (3/5):</strong>The plan right now is to submit this as a <a href='http://ben.balter.com/tag/gsoc/'>Google Summer of Code</a> project, so if all goes well, look for the above-outlined functionality in a WordPress install near you towards the end of the summer. In the mean time, the continued thoughts/feedback is very greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update (3/27):</strong>It looks like <a href='http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/no-gsoc-2012/'>WordPress isn&#8217;t participating in GSoC this year</a>. Filing this idea under &#8220;someday&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update (6/13):</strong>Stay tuned. This may yet become a reality after all.
