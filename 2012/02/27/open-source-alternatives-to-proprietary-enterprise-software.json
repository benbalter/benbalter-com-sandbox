Today, I hope the community can help even the odds with this collaboratively edited list of open-source alternatives to typical government and enterprise software needs</p>\n\n<p>I was thrilled to come across<a href='https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/Open-Source-Option-v1.pdf'>this comprehensive list of open-source options for government</a> last week, part of the UK&#8217;s <a href='https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-source-procurement-toolkit'>Open Source Procurement Toolkit</a>, but was disappointed to see, in addition to it being published in most government agencies favorite web publishing format (PDF), it hadn&#8217;t been updated in more than a year.</p>\n\n<p>With a little find-and-replace magic, I converted the PDF into a stand-alone web page (based on <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/'>Twitter&#8217;s open-source Bootstrap</a> and <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>), cleaned up a few typos, and <a href='http://benbalter.github.com/open-source-alternatives/'>published it to GitHub</a> in hopes that it can be collaboratively edited by the broader open-source community.</p>\n\n<p>Please <a href='http://benbalter.github.com/open-source-alternatives/'>browse the list</a>, and if you find any additions, corrections, or improvements, <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/open-source-alternatives'>fork the page on GitHub</a> and <a href='http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/'>submit a pull request</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Live Site: <strong><a href='http://benbalter.github.com/open-source-alternatives/'>Open-Source Alternatives to Proprietary Enterprise Software</a></strong></p>"}
