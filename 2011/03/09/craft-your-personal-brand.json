Below are slides and a recording of the livestream.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I invite you to watch, but in short, the main takeaways were:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><img alt='Why Brand?' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/branding-300x224.png' />In the olden days, people used to be scared to put personal information online; they felt the need to be pseudonymous (<em>see</em> handles like SparklePrincess87); life online was distinct from life offline.</li>\n\n<li>As more of our analog lives became digital, the need for a second identity diminished; we no longer represent ourselves with anonymous screen names, but rather as ourselves.</li>\n\n<li>Social networking and mobile computing contributed to this shift by interfacing the online and offline worlds. Today&#8217;s radical transparency (<em>e.g.,</em> lifecasters posting pictures of their lunch) shows we have come a full 180.</li>\n\n<li>We shift from corporate brand associations in the 50s (<em>e.g.,</em> &#8220;I work for IBM&#8221;) to personal brands today (<em>e.g.,</em> &#8221;I&#8217;m an independent contractor&#8221;).</li>\n\n<li>Today we all have a unique opportunity to plant a flag on our corner of the internet, take control of our online identity, and declare to the world who we are by crafting a thought-out narrative.</li>\n\n<li>Unlike in the real world where you are the only one in control of what you say, online, content has a life of its own â€” you must be proactive.</li>\n\n<li>WordPress makes it dumb simple to tell the world your story.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>My five big steps to launching your brand:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Grab a domain</li>\n\n<li>Define your personal brand</li>\n\n<li>Start a blog</li>\n\n<li>Socialize your content</li>\n\n<li>Upgrade your resume</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Recording of the livestream:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em><a href='http://www.greglinch.com/'>Greg Linch</a> opens by discussing WordPress and Journalism, I begin at 30m 10s</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Accompanying slides if you wish to follow along:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For those interested in the plugins mentioned:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href='http://ben.balter.com/2010/09/12/wordpress-resume-plugin/' title='WordPress Resume Plugin'>Resume Plugin for WordPress</a></li>\n\n<li><a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/01/11/wordpress-emphasis-plugin/' title='WordPress Emphasis Plugin: Highlight and Permalink Text'>Emphasis Plugin for WordPress</a></li>\n\n<li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/'>All in One SEO</a></li>\n\n<li><a href='http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/'>Google Analytics for WordPress</a></li>\n\n<li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-facebook-connect/'>Simple Facebook Connect</a></li>\n\n<li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-twitter-connect/'>Simple Twitter Connect</a></li>\n\n<li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/subscribe-to-comments/'>Subscribe to Comments</a></li>\n\n<li><a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/'>Syntax Highlighter Evolved</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Resources:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href='http://rapportive.com/'>Rapportive</a></li>\n\n<li><a href='http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/10/13/bit-ly-now-lets-you-add-qr-codes-to-links-in-seconds/'>How to generate a QR code</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A special thanks to everyone who was able to come out or follow along on the livestream.</p>\n\n<p>Comments?
