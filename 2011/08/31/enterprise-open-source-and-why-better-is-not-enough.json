To be fair, the business world, and even more so CIO&#8217;s, see avoiding uncertainty and minimizing risk as a core competency, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the whole story.</p>\n\n<p>The rapid pace of innovation has rendered many stakeholders and decision makers out of the loop when it comes to where a given technology stands in relation to their current practices, and for good reason: disruptive technology poses a risk not only on a organization level, but on a personal level as well.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>From a practical standpoint</strong>, all other things remaining constant, a firm&#8217;s move to the cloud, for example, <a href='http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/1381193/IT-job-security-fears-over-cloud-computing-Network-jobs-still-vital'>brings into question the security of the sysadmin</a> that has spent years building up a fiefdom of server farms.</li>\n\n<li><strong>From a skills standpoint</strong>, there&#8217;s a whole generation out there that grew up on the Internet, and many of those in a position to make purchasing decisions or recommendation are simply not part of it. A young upstart consultant coming in and showing up the veteran can potentially be a recurring (and realistic) <a href='http://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2000/techtech/tt16.pdf'>nightmare for many baby boomers</a>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>From a professional standpoint</strong>, at its most basic level, risk is taken by individuals (who propose a new system, procedure, etc.), which in many organizations may have an incentive to adopt a &#8220;don&#8217;t rock the boat&#8221; mentality for their own career&#8217;s sake, rather than <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax'>risk being wrong</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If technological innovation were simply a matter of calculated risk and switching costs, one would expect firms to be <em>equally</em> as unlikely to upgrade an existing technology as they would be to switch to a new one. Mathematically, upgrading in-house servers to the next version of Microsoft Exchange may<a href='http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/messaging_value.html'>far outweigh</a> a move to the cloud. Yet, large firms have been <a href='http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/07/paving-road-to-apps-adoption-in-large.html'>slow to make the change</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a whole world out there of distributed, open innovation that, with the exception of a few startups, <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> has been widely ignored by IT departments, and as Yochai Benkler argues in <em><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Networks-Production-Transforms-Markets/dp/0300110561'>The Wealth of Networks</a>,</em> if history suggests anything, it is that the proprietary model is on its way to the endangered species list.</p>\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s the answer? How can open source fanatics and other early adopters rescue the change averse from their self-perpetuated anachronisms?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Talk about <em>solutions</em> not technology</strong> – Geeks love shiny new things. It&#8217;s in our DNA. Yet rarely are geeks the one making the decisions. Decision makers could often care less which acronym powers something, but rather than dumb things down (&#8220;this thingy talks to that thingy&#8221;), translate the situation in terms of <a href='http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_82.htm'>organizational change</a> (&#8220;it will wholly eliminate the need for paper forms&#8221;). Rarely does technology change without the organization following suit. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Solution-Selling-Creating-Difficult-Markets/dp/0786303158'>Approach the situation as a human problem</a>, not a technical one.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Move past &#8221;<em>If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it</em>&#8221;</strong> – &#8221;<em>It&#8217;s good enough</em>&#8221; should never be a persuasive argument for stagnation. Just because something has been used in the past, does not mean that it should. <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> &lt;/em&gt;In software development, changes fit into one of two categories: bugs and enhancements. Saying that something &#8220;works&#8221; ignores exactly half of the equation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Broadcast excellence</strong>- If you ask me why an organization should use SharePoint, I have at my fingertips <a href='http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/product/benefits/Pages/default.aspx'>focus-group tested ammunition</a>.
