Leveraging a previous tool I had built called <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/Site-Inspector'>Site Inspector</a> which provides information about a domain and its technical capabilities, I imported the list into the content management system WordPress, and created a plugin called <a href='https://github.com/benbalter/Domain-Inventory'>Domain Inventory</a>to scan each domain and curate the results. A summary of my preliminary results appears below, as well as a link to the browsable dataset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The project tracks each Federal Executive .Gov by:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agency</strong>(as provided in the data.gov list)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Server status</strong> (response code, if it is reachable, etc.)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Non-WWW support</strong> (is www. required to access the site)</li>\n\n<li><strong>IPv6 Support</strong> (is it reachable via next generation technology)</li>\n\n<li><strong>CDN Provider</strong> (do they use a content distribution network, if so what)</li>\n\n<li><strong>CMS</strong> (do they use a content management system, if so what)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Cloud Provider</strong> (are they hosted in the cloud, if so by whom)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Analytics Source</strong> (do they track visitors, if so how)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Script Library</strong> (do they use common javascript libraries)</li>\n\n<li><strong>HTTPs Support</strong> (is the site browsable via the secure HTTPS protocol)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Highlights of the Preliminary Results:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only 73% of domains are <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/status/live/'>live and in use</a></li>\n\n<li><em>Of live domains</em> 80% are accessible <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/nonwww/yes/'>without typing the www. prefix</a>.</li>\n\n<li>Only 10 sites fully support the federally mandated <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/ipv6/yes/'>IPv6 standard</a>.</li>\n\n<li>87 domains use the <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cdn/akamai/'>Akamai</a> content distribution network.</li>\n\n<li>12 are believed to be in the cloud, including 10 in <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cloud/amazon/'>Amazon</a>, and 2 in <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cloud/rackspace/'>Rackspace</a>.</li>\n\n<li>103 use some form of analytics, with <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/analytics/google-analytics/'>Google Analytics</a> being the most popular, found on 86 domains.</li>\n\n<li>Drupal is<a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cms/drupal/'>by far the most popular CMS</a>, powering nearly twice as many domains as all other CMSs combined.</li>\n\n<li><a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cms/wordpress/'>WordPress</a> is the second most popular primary CMS (17), followed by Microsoft <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cms/sharepoint/'>SharePoint</a> (13).</li>\n\n<li>93% of <em>live</em> domains use <a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/cms/none/'>no detectable CMS</a>, or use a custom-built solution.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Slightly more than half of live servers are powered by</p>\n\n<p><a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com/server_software/commercial/'>commercial software.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>The full, browsable dataset:<a href='http://dotgov.benbalter.com'>http://dotgov.benbalter.com</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Please note: This data is to be treated as preliminary and is provided &#8220;as is&#8221; with no guarantee as to its validity.

If you find a systemic error, I encourage you to fork the code and I will try my best to recrawl the list to improve the data&#8217;s accuracy.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update (10/4)</strong>: Updated the above statistics (and underlying data) based on an updated domain list published on data.gov and recrawled using the same tools. The above numbers now use the number of <em>live</em> sites (rather than total number of domains) as the denominator for percentages, and excludes approximately 300 domains which simply redirects to other .govs.</p>"}
