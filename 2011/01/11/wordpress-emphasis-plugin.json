In their own words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Emphasis provides dynamic paragraph-specific anchor links and the ability to highlight text in a document, all of which is made available in the URL hash so it can be emailed, bookmarked, or shared.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I adapted the New York Time&#8217;s implementation into a three-line WordPress plugin for my own site, and it is available in the <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-emphasis/'>WordPress plugin repository</a> as a one-click install, if you would like to add it to your own.</p>\n\n<p>The &#8220;deep links&#8221; plugin allows for permalinking and highlighting of text on a paragraph and sentance level. No need to set anything up. Just install, tap shift twice, and start highlighting.</p>\n\n<p><em>See</em> <a href='http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/emphasis-update-and-source/'>The New York Times post on the script</a> for syntax and more information on general usage or you can double tap the <em>shift</em> key right now to give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>Neat, huh? <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-emphasis/'>Download it</a> today.</p>\n\n<p><em>Enjoy using WP Emphasis?
