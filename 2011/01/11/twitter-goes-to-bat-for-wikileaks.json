What is troubling, however, is that presumably other service providers, <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jan/08/wikileaks-calls-google-facebook-us-subpoenas'>such as Google and Facebook</a>, could have received similar requests and silently acquiesced to the government&#8217;s demands.</p>\n\n<p>While many companies, including <a href='http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html'>Google</a> and <a href='http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/details.html'>Yahoo</a>, have a policy of informing users of such requests when legally permissible, in this case, Twitter&#8217;s contention of the gag order, and the resulting opportunity to pursue legal action it subsequently afforded its users, was somewhat heroic, at least by internet standards, and is a practice other firms should follow.
