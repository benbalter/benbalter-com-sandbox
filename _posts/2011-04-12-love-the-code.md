I am gave a brief [lightning talk at April's WordPress DC Meetup][1] on the basics of HTML and PHP ("coding for dummies"). The goal: learn how to avoid breaking your website if you edit it. Below are the [slides][2] and [recording][3].

**In invite you to [watch][2], but in short, the Cliff's Notes are:**

*   The process 
    *   The server executes PHP and outputs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.![][4]
    *   The user's browser takes that output and renders a visual representation of the page
*   Client-side Languages 
    *   HTML – Static (unchanging) content; provides structure
    *   CSS – Provides style and form
    *   JavaScript – Provides interactivity
*   PHP – Wrapped with "`php`" and "`?>`" 
    *   Variable - Text, a number, true/false, or a group of variable; identified by "`$`"
    *   `If` Statement – performs an action *if* a statement is true
    *   `While` Loop – performs an action *while* a statement is true
    *   `For` / `Foreach` – combines elements of `while` and `if`
    *   Functions – predefined set of actions; always followed by "`( )`"
    *   Don't forget semicolons
