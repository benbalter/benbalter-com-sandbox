[![Open Source Alternatives Screenshot][1]][2]I've said in the past, that open-source's lack of adoption in the enterprise space is due, at least in part, to the lack of "[focus-group tested ammunition][2]". Today, I hope the community can help even the odds with this collaboratively edited list of open-source alternatives to typical government and enterprise software needs

I was thrilled to come across[ this comprehensive list of open-source options for government][3] last week, part of the UK's [Open Source Procurement Toolkit][4], but was disappointed to see, in addition to it being published in most government agencies favorite web publishing format (PDF), it hadn't been updated in more than a year.

With a little find-and-replace magic, I converted the PDF into a stand-alone web page (based on [Twitter's open-source Bootstrap][5] and [Jekyll][6]), cleaned up a few typos, and [published it to GitHub][7] in hopes that it can be collaboratively edited by the broader open-source community.

Please [browse the list][7], and if you find any additions, corrections, or improvements, [fork the page on GitHub][8] and [submit a pull request][9].
