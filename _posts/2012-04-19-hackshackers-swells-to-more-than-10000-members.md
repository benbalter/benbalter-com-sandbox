[Hacks/Hackers][2] — the international grassroots journalism organization dedicated to creating a network of journalists and technologists to rethink the future of news and information — [welcomed its 10,000th member][3] today. Just two and half years after our start as a Meetup group in the Bay Area, we're now in [seven countries, across 26 cities, and have regular events on four continents][4].

> People have found jobs, co-founders for startups, acquirers for their company, learned new skills, hacked out projects, shown off their work and so much more at Hacks/Hackers events [...and w]ith 10,000 members, we're only getting started.
